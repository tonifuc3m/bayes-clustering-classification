# bayes-clustering-classification
Collection of Bayesian clustering and classification techniques with the Fifa dataset.

Authors: Manuel Rodr√≠guez, Sergio Arias and Antonio Miranda (me).

This R Markdown takes a lot to compile in a regular laptop, so I have included the compiled HTML to visualize the results in case you are only interested in having a look at the results. 

The project is a complete analysis of the Fifa dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/kevinmh/fifa-18-more-complete-player-dataset#complete.csv). The steps are: 
1. Introduction: motivation of the work and that stuff.
2. Quick Dataset preparation. 
3. Descriptive Analysis: find out the main characteristics of the different attributes and classes of the dataset.
4. Bayesian clustering: Finite mixture of Gaussians
5. Bayesian classification: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression (and comparison with frequentist approach), Probit Regression, Gaussian Processes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
6. Conclusions.

Not only code but also theory about the algorithms used is provided.
